# HDM-Clone-CPC
A copy of HDM Demo 1 on the Amstrad CPC

Copy of HDM Demo 1 by Happy DemoMaker

There's an Pasmo assembled HDM.dsk included which has been tested on an Amstrad CPC464 but should at least theoretically work on most other models. The build.bat will, if Pasmo and CPCDiskXP are both present, assemble the demo.

(Sorry about the n00bish Z80 here, this is only my second CPC release and fourth piece of Z80 code since learning whilst bored on IRC one night! =-) 

T.M.R =-)
